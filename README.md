  ### Machine Learning Practice File
     * End-to-end structured data projects (classification and regression)
     * Perform following steps 
        - Getting the data ready
        - Choose the right estimator/algorithem for problems
        - Fit the model/algorithem and use it to make predictions on our data
        - Evaluating a model
        - Improve the model
        - Save and Load a trained model

  
  ### Kaggle advanced regression technique project
A end to end model to predict the value of a given house in the  market using various statistical analysis tools. 
Identified the best price that a client can sell their house utilizing machine learning model.   
Kaggle provides a data dictionary detailing all of the features of the dataset.

  ### Numpy
Numpy is a library of high level mathmatical functions to operate. In this section we try to learn basics functions of numpy like min , max , sorting , fency indexing , sorting arrays,broadcasting etc.

  ### Data Visualisation library
Matplotlib - Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
      In this section we learn single or multi ploting on canvas , box plot , histogram .   
Seaborn library - Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.Here we explore different plot like histogram , pair plot, bar plot, violin plot, cluster plot etc.

  ### Data Analysis project
In these projects we try to get insight through python different libraries like pandas , numpy, matplotlib , seaborn by using their functions .
